# DRIVE-CALCI
GUI based application , which can be used to find Powertrain Sizing of an Electric Vehicle by providing vehicle parameters and performance &amp; range requirement based on any drive cycle.

# Working
This drive calci works really smooth and in a very user friendly way it calculates the **Powertrain Sizing of Electric Vehicle**. It just takes few inputs in order to calculate the desired output:
 * Vehicle Data (such as Vehicle weights, Frontal Area, Wheel radius, drag coefficients.... etc.)
 * Velocity ~ Time Data
 * Available Motor Sizing Data

A video is attached here to see the working of app. [Watch Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cyETdIqP_Ovo-pytUQpOFe6pMyQiNuD3/view)
